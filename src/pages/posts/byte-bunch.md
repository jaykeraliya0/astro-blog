## How to deploy

1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaykeraliya0/Project-Byte-Bunch
```

2. upload your images and metadata files to ipfs and copy CID of metada **(don't forgate to link images in metadata jsons)**

3. Go to backend/contracts/ and edit ByteBunch.sol smart contract according to your requirements.

```solidity
uint256 public cost = 0.01 ether; // price per nft
uint256 public maxSupply = 10000; // maximum nuber of nfts of your collection
uint256 public maxMintAmountPerTx = 5; // number of nfts user can mint per transection
```

```solidity
constructor() ERC721("NAME", "SYMBOL") {
    setHiddenMetadataUri("ipfs:///__CID__.json");
}
```

update above feilds in smart contract

4. install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

5. configure hardhat.config.ts and deploy contract

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

6. copy and save your contract deployed address from console

7. build and run frontend next.js

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
